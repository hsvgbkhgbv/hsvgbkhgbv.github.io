Short Bio
-----
I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Manchester, UK. My main research interest rests in multi-agent reinforcement learning, robust reinforcement learning and ad hoc teamwork. About multi-agent reinforcement learning and ad hoc teamwork, I mainly focus on designing algorithms from the perspective of cooperative game theory. I trust that the incoporation of fundamental mechanisms from game theory into developing learning algorithms can shed light on interpretability, transparency and reliability of the modern learning based multi-agent systems. Moreover, I am also interested in applying machine learning algorithms (especially multi-agent reinforcement learning) to real-world problems and physical systems (e.g. electric power systems, robotics and chatbot). My current vision is deriving a theoretically guaranteed method to gear multiple large language models towards collaborating to complete a task, where the whole decision process is naturally interpretable, controllable and trustworthy to human beings.

I obtained my PhD degree from Imperial College London, UK, in 2023, under supervision of [Dr. Yunjie Gu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NyTj-m8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Tim C. Green](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PWvm-uEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Tae-Kyun Kim](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=j2WcLecAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I obtained my M.Res. degree from University College London (UCL), UK, with the distinction degree, in 2018, under supervision of [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from University of Liverpool, UK, with the first class degree, in 2016, and my final year project supervisors are [Prof. Danushka Bollegala](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kLqCYLMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Karl Tuyls](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cxRqeVwAAAAJ&hl=en).
