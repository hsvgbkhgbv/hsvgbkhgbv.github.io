Ph.D. Thesis
-----
My Ph.D. thesis entitled "Shapley Value Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Theory, Method and Its Application to Energy Network" is available in [Spiral, Imperial College’s open access repository](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/109306).

Short Bio
-----
I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Manchester, UK, working with [Prof. Samuel Kaski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uF6H9jMAAAAJ&hl=en). My primary research pursuits revolve around multi-agent reinforcement learning, robust reinforcement learning and ad hoc teamwork. About multi-agent reinforcement learning and ad hoc teamwork, my emphasis lies in designing algorithms through the lens of [cooperative game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory). I firmly believe that integrating fundamental mechanisms from game theory into the development of learning algorithms can shed light on interpretability, transparency and reliability of comtemporary learning based multi-agent systems. Beyond theoretical endeavors, I am passionate about the practical applications of machine learning algorithms (particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning) to real-world problems (e.g. electric power systems, robotics and chatbots). My current research vision revolves around developing a theoretically grounded approach to coordinate multiple large language models (LLMs) towards collaborating to accomplish a real-world task, where the whole sequential decision process is naturally interpretable and controllable to human. Nevertheless, the hallucination of LLMs could hamper the trustworthiness of interpretation. To alleviate this issue, I stand on the side of designing, architectures and learning algorithms, for LLMs, grounded on the mechanism of game theory, to regulate their behaviours.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Imperial College London, UK, in 2024, under supervision of [Dr. Yunjie Gu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NyTj-m8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Tim C. Green](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PWvm-uEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Tae-Kyun Kim](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=j2WcLecAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I obtained my M.Res. degree from University College London (UCL), UK, with distinction, in 2018, under supervision of [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&hl=en), as well as my M.Sc. degree from Imperial College London, UK, with merit, in 2017, under supervision of [Prof. Björn Schuller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TxKNCSoAAAAJ&hl=en) for the master project. Earlier, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from University of Liverpool, UK, with the first-class honours degree, in 2016, under supervison of [Prof. Danushka Bollegala](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kLqCYLMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Karl Tuyls](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cxRqeVwAAAAJ&hl=en) for the final year project.
