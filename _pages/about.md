Research Interest
-----
My main research interest rests in multi-agent reinforcement learning, robust reinforcement learning and ad hoc teamwork. About multi-agent reinforcement learning and ad hoc teamwork, I mainly focus on designing algorithms, standing on the perspective of cooperative game theory. Besides, I am also interested in applying machine learning algorithms (especially multi-agent reinforcement learning) to real-world problems (e.g. electric power system, robotics and etc.).
