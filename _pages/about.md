Ph.D. Thesis
-----
My Ph.D. thesis entitled [Shapley Value Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Theory, Method and Its Application to Energy Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15324) is available online.

Short Bio
-----
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Manchester, UK, working with [Prof. Samuel Kaski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uF6H9jMAAAAJ&hl=en), and a member of the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems ([ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/members)).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering Research from Imperial College London, UK, in 2024, under supervision of [Dr. Yunjie Gu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NyTj-m8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Tim C. Green](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PWvm-uEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Tae-Kyun Kim](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=j2WcLecAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I obtained my M.Res. degree in Web Science and Big Data Analytics, from University College London (UCL), UK, with distinction, in 2018, under supervision of [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&hl=en), as well as my M.Sc. degree in Computing (Machine Learning), from Imperial College London, UK, with merit, in 2017, under supervision of [Prof. Bj√∂rn Schuller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TxKNCSoAAAAJ&hl=en) for the master project. Earlier, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, from University of Liverpool, UK, with the first-class honours degree, in 2016, under supervison of [Prof. Danushka Bollegala](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kLqCYLMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Karl Tuyls](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cxRqeVwAAAAJ&hl=en) for the final year project.

Research Interests
-----
My primary research interests revolve around Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Robust Reinforcement Learning and Ad Hoc Teamwork. About Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Ad Hoc Teamwork, my emphasis lies in designing algorithms through the lens of [Cooperative Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory). I firmly believe that integrating fundamental mechanisms from Game Theory into the development of learning algorithms can shed light on interpretability, transparency and reliability of comtemporary learning-based Multi-Agent Systems. Beyond theoretical endeavors, I am passionate about the practical applications of Machine Learning algorithms (particularly Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) to Autonomous Systems (e.g. Smart Grids, Robotics, Dialogue Systems, etc.).

Academic Activities
-----
- 09/08/2024: Co-organizing a workshop called [Coordination and Cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/cocomarl-2024/home) (CoCoMARL) at the [Reinforcement Learning Conference 2024](https://rl-conference.cc/) (RLC 2024). The aim of this workshop is to promote the advancement of cooperative and coordinated multi-agent reinforcement learning in both theory and real-world applications (e.g. swarm robotics, traffic management, etc.). To achieve the goal, this workshop is constituted of paper submissions, invited talks and panel discussions.
